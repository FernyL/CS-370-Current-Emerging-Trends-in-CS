# CS-370-Current-Emerging-Trends-in-CS

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The code given to me were the TreasureMaze.py which represents the environment and the GameExperience.py file which stores the episodes. The code I created myself was the Q-Training algorithm code block within the Lomeli_Fernando_ProjectTwo.ipynb file. This is where I implemented deep Q-learning to find the best route to the treasure while maximizing the reward and acheiving a win rate of 100%.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists are essential for solving problems in the tech world by designing and developing programs used daily by millions of users. They have extensive knowledge in designing/developing software and analyzing trends to solve problems for organizations.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I approach a problem by breaking it down into more simple sections and taking it one step at a time. I continuously test my work from the beggining of development to the end. I ensure to use object-oriented programming principles to ensure my work is modular, organized, and adaptable. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities to the end user and organization are transparency, to ensure fairness, and to ensure that no biases occur within AI machine learning. All training data being used should be reviewed and analyzed so that it is accurate and free of errors and bias. Another ethical responsibily we have is to be completely transparent to the end user about what data is being collected and how it is being used.
